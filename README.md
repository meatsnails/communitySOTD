Community Song of the Day twitter bot source code \
turns out that you need to pay 200 smackaroos every month to upload files longer then 2 minutes from the api \
so essnetially that means I can't use this code well everything functions I belive just im broke. so if you wish to use this poorly written code here you go!

note the code expects a artist.txt and cover.jpg in every subfolder of your set "media_directory" in settings.yml \
the artist.txt is for like a link to the artists bandcamp while the cover.jpg is the picture used for every song by a artist. \
if there is no cover.jpg it should turn out a black video with the audio.

and obviously this code requires ffmpeg to use.
